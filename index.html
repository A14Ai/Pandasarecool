                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Giant pandas are charismatic black and white bears native to the bamboo forests of China. Known for their cuddly appearance and relaxed demeanor, they primarily feed on bamboo. Despite their iconic status, giant pandas have faced significant threats to their survival and are considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring their future.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-4">Breeding</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Giant pandas have a complex and often challenging breeding process. Females have a very short window of fertility each year, typically only 24-72 hours. They usually give birth to one or two cubs, though often only one survives in the wild. Cubs are born very small and helpless, weighing only about 100 grams, and require intensive maternal care. Breeding programs in captivity and habitat preservation are vital for increasing panda populations.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-4">Diet and Habitat</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The diet of giant pandas is almost exclusively bamboo, making up 99% of their intake. They spend a significant portion of their day (up to 14 hours) eating large quantities of bamboo to meet their nutritional needs. Their strong jaws and specialized teeth are perfectly adapted for crushing tough bamboo stalks. Pandas live in isolated mountainous regions of central China, specifically in damp bamboo forests at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet, which provide their primary food source and shelter.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-4">Predators</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Adult giant pandas have very few natural predators due to their large size and strength. However, young cubs are more vulnerable. Potential predators for panda cubs can include large carnivores like snow leopards, dholes (wild dogs), and even some birds of prey. The primary threat to pandas, however, is not predation but habitat loss and human encroachment.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-4">Conservation Status</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Giant pandas were once classified as endangered, but thanks to intensive conservation efforts, their status was changed to vulnerable by the IUCN in 2016. This is a significant success story for conservation. However, they still face ongoing threats from habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities. Continued conservation efforts, including habitat protection, reforestation, and anti-poaching measures, are essential for the long-term survival of giant pandas in the wild.</p>

                    <li>Giant pandas have a "thumb" which is actually a modified wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo.</li>
                    <li>They can climb trees and are surprisingly good swimmers.</li>
                    <li>A group of pandas is sometimes called an "embarrassment," though pandas are mostly solitary animals.</li>
                    <li>Newborn panda cubs are incredibly tiny, about the size of a stick of butter, and are pink and hairless.</li>
                    <li>Despite being bears, their digestive system is more like a carnivore's, making them inefficient at digesting bamboo, hence why they eat so much!</li>
